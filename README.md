# Cyberstorm-Final-Project-CYEN132
Final project for our cyber/cs class
Theme of Cyberstorm is Constellation
Parameters for the project: It must use GPIO with Rpi, Python, and be a puzzle.


Ideas for the project:
  Steganography- hidden messages in pictures and put that in the room adventure and then
  get them to solve the room adventure using clues they find in the pictures.

  Have a picture with clues, use binary values to represent a URL, and have that reference
  a specific PDF version of a book or other text source, have them find a specific passage
  or word in that, then use that in combination with other things to solve a secret puzzle.
  It may link to a password nesseccary for using steganogaphy to find a secret message in
  a picture.

  Hexadecimal code for hiding a message.

  Dax:
    giving different parts of the puzzle to different teams.
    they have to work together without letting the other teams win
    or they have to break into the other teams to find the other parts

    maybe incorporate Project Euler puzzles?
